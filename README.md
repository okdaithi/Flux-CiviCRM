# FluxCiviCRM

Objective: Test CiviCRM as a CRM solution for all for Flux's major organisation CRM tasks.

Problem: Flux does not have a fit-for-purpose CRM solution.

Possible Solution: CiviCRM is an open-source CRM with extensibility options, open source community and considerable in-built functionality. It could be implemented and configured to replace services such as Mailchimp, fundraisz, and additional functionality related to membership management, volunteer engagment and events.

Things to test:
Functionality map - what services do we require? what does CiviCRM offer?
Extensions - what extensions would be required? paypal / maps / etc?
Integrations - how will FCCRM integrate? e.g. membership exports, etc
Security - how does CiviCRM protect user data?
